    <h1><strong></strong>Body-Centred Cubic (BCC) Lattice structure<strong></strong></h1>
      <h2 class="something">
      This is a typical lattice structure where the atomic planes or lattice planes lie within the gaps of the lower planes of the respective atoms. <br>
      In this type, the unit cell is shaped like a cube. It means that one atom is directly in contact with eight other atoms or lattice points. <br>
      wThis type of arrangement can be found in vanadium, tungsten, and chromium.<br>
      Hexagonal Closest Packed (HCP) Lattice Structure
      The superposed atoms or lattice points create gaps where the underlying plane can fit into the upper one. <br>
      The atomic levels are closely packed, creating a hexagonal closest packed (HCP) lattice structure.<br>
      Metals like cobalt, zinc, titanium, and magnesium show such types of lattice arrangement.<br>
      A point is connected with 12 neighbouring points making its coordination number 12.<br>
      Body centered Body Unit Cell (BCC)<br>
      The BCC unit cell has atoms in each corner of the cube and the atom in the center of the structure.<br>
      According to this structure, the atom in the center of the body entirely belongs to the cell unit in which it is located.<br>
In the BCC unit cell every corner has atoms.<br>
There is one atom in the center of the building<br>
At the bottom of the drawing is an open structure<br>
According to this the atom of the structure in the physical organs is entirely the cell of the unit in which it is located.<br>
Number of atoms in a BCC cell:<br>
Therefore, in the BCC cell, we have:<br>
8 x 1/8 corners with each atom = 8  1/8 = 1 atom<br>
1 physical center atom = 1+1 = 2 atoms<br><br>
Hence, here the total number of atoms that are present per cell unit = 2 atoms. </h2>
