      <h1><strong></strong>Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Lattice Structure<strong></strong></h1>
      <h2 class="something">
        FCC (Face-Centered cubic): Atoms are sually arranged at the corners and even at the center of the surface of each given cell cabinet.<br>
        Atoms are considered to affect the diagonals of the face. 4 atoms in a single unit cell.<br>
        Atoms are arranged in the corners of the cube and another atom in the center of the cube.
        This lattice structure also packs the maximum number of atomic planes in a stacking sequence.<br>
        The second layer of atoms is primarily stacked following the HCP structure in the underlying <br>
        layer gaps. The third layer, on the contrary, lies in the free gaps. The metals like copper, lead, and nickel shows such types of solid crystal lattice arrangements.<br>
        The coordination number of this crystal structure is 12.<br>
        The FCC unit cell contains atoms in all corners of the crystal lattice and in the center of each cube surface. An atomic surface atom is divided between cells in two adjacent units and only 1/2 of each atom in each cell.

In the FCC unit cell atoms are present in all corners of the crystal lattice<br>

Also, there is an atom in the center of the whole surface of the cake<br>

This atomic center atom is divided between cells in two adjacent units<br>

Only about 12 atoms are part of a cell<br>

Number of atoms in a FCC cell<br>

a) 8 x 1/8 corners with each atom = 8 x 1/8 = 1 atom<br>

b) Six surface atoms x 1/2 atom per unit of cell = 3 atoms<br>

Therefore, the total number of atoms in a cell cell = 4 atoms<br>

Therefore, in the cellic unit centered on the surface, we have:<br>

8 x 1/8 corners with each atom = 8 × 1/8 = 1 atom<br>

Six atoms centered on the surface × 1/2 atom per unit of cell = 3 atoms<br><br>

Therefore, the total number of atoms in a cell cell = 4 atoms.<br>
