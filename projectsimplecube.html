        <h1><strong></strong>Primitive Cubic Structure Lattice structure<strong></strong></h1>
        <h2 class="something">
          In this arrangement, the constituent lattice points hold the corner positions only.<br>
          In the first cell of the cubic unit, atoms are found only in the corners. Every atom in a corner is shared between cells in eight adjacent units.<br>
           There are four unit cells in the same layer as 4 in the upper (or lower) layer. Thus, a single unit of cell has only 1 / 8th of an atom. <br>
           Each subdivision in each of the following figures represents the particle center in that particular position and not its size. <br>
           This building is known as the open-air building.<br>

Atoms in the first phase of the simple cubic unit cell are found only in the corners<br>

All the atoms in the corner are divided between the cells of the eight adjacent units<br>

Four unit cells exist in the same layer<br>

One unit cell is in the upper / lower layer<br>

Thus, a single cell unit has only 18 atoms<br>

Each subdivision in each of the following figures represents the particle center in that particular position and not its size<br>

In each cell of the cubic unit, there are 8 atoms in the corners. Therefore, the total number of atoms in a single cell cell is<br>

8 Ã— 1/8 = 1 atom.<br>
